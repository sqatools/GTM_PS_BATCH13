Learning multibranching

Use branches to keep separate lines of development and create as many as you need. Basic multibranch workflow (command line + GitHub):

Start from the branch you want to branch off (usually main):
Update local repo: git pull
Create and switch to a new branch:
git branch BRANCH-NAME
git checkout BRANCH-NAME
Or in one step: git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME
Make changes, stage and commit:
git add . (or specific files)
git commit -m "short description of change"
Push the branch to GitHub:
First push (set upstream): git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH-NAME
Subsequent pushes: git push
Repeat steps 2–4 to create and work on additional branches (feature branches, topic branches).
Keep branches up to date with remote changes:
Switch to the target branch (e.g., main) and git pull
Merge or rebase changes into your feature branch as needed (use git merge from the branch you want to update)
Open a pull request on GitHub to merge a branch into the base branch (maintainers should review). After merging on GitHub, delete merged branches to keep the repo clean.
If you use GitHub Desktop, create and switch branches via the Current Branch menu, commit locally, then push (or use Branch → Squash and Merge into Current Branch when appropriate), and use Fetch/Pull (Fetch origin / Pull origin) to keep local branches updated.
